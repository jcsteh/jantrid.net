Josh is fairly clingy with Jen at the moment, especially at night. One evening last week, Jen, Josh and I were all lying in bed, with me cuddling Josh. We were wondering whether Josh would be happy with that this night. Soon after, Josh, who has been babbling mamama for a while now, said with total clarity, "mmmuummm." Surely that was just amusing but unintentional? He doesn't know what Mum means yet. A few seconds later, "mmmmmuuuuummmmm." Right. Even if it was unintentional, how could we resist that? Jen took him and he settled without further protest.
