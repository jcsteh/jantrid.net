<blockquote><strong>A blind man assaulted a child on a Brisbane bus just before 9 this morning.</strong>
<br />James Teh, a 21 year old unemployed musician, attempted to squash the boy with his rather large backpack.
<br />"I didn't realise the poor kid was sitting on the seat next to me," Teh told police. "I was carrying two bags and was trying to get them both into a workable position as I sat down."
<br />
<br />This is just one of many incidents of unprovoked assault by a blind person, citing their disability to excuse this unacceptable behaviour. Even if such acts are accidental as they claim, blind people seem to believe that their lack of sight is justification for their failure to see others nearby.
<br />"Damn blindies," a young high school music teacher commented. "You just can't trust 'em."</blockquote>
