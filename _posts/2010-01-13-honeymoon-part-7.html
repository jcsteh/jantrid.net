<br />Jamie: We had a pretty quiet new year's day, having slept rather badly due to the insane, spectacular, long-lasting fireworks and other celebration the previous night.
<br />
<br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yc4WLP6MjGk/S006CyZ8JtI/AAAAAAAAAG0/zzUv7_1RYd4/s1600-h/IMG_0250.JPG"><img style="display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 240px; height: 320px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yc4WLP6MjGk/S006CyZ8JtI/AAAAAAAAAG0/zzUv7_1RYd4/s320/IMG_0250.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5426056945616037586" border="0"></a><font style="font-style: italic;">The view out of our window just bef</font><font style="font-style: italic;">ore midnight. Everyone was moving toward  Piazza del Popolo to watch the fireworks - but we had a great view from  the hotel.</font>
<br /></div>
<br />Before leaving Rome, we visited the Spanish Steps and the Trevi Fountain. We didn't walk all the way up the Spanish Steps due to major crowding, but we did walk about half way up. I was fascinated to see such a long, wide set of steps. There are no turns; it just goes straight up with landings in between. It was difficult for me to get a true sense of the Trevi Fountain, as much of it was out of my reach, but its width, its length and the volume of water cascading therein was pretty spectacular.
<br />
<br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yc4WLP6MjGk/S006i9TztjI/AAAAAAAAAHE/g-oAoQ8wLBo/s1600-h/IMG_0273.JPG"><img style="display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 240px; height: 320px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yc4WLP6MjGk/S006i9TztjI/AAAAAAAAAHE/g-oAoQ8wLBo/s320/IMG_0273.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5426057498298922546" border="0"></a>
<br /><font style="font-style: italic;">The beautiful Trevi Fountain.
<br />
<br /></font></div>I've been researching the various places before or soon after we visited them. Associating the history with the real thing is quite fascinating.
<br />
<br />We arrived in Florence on Saturday afternoon. Over a half bottle of wine in the hotel bar, we saw a brochure for a tour company called FunInTuscany which does wine tours and Tuscan cooking classes, among other things. We'd wanted to do something like this while in Europe, but hadn't had any luck booking such before we left. Tours were either hideously over-priced or unavailable at this time of year, so we'd pretty much given up on being able to do it. We called FunInTuscany and were delighted when we discovered that we were able to book a combined wine tour and cooking class for the next day.
<br />
<br />It turned out to be probably the best day of our honeymoon. After a rocky start (we couldn't find the meeting point and were worried we'd miss the tour), we found the tour van, were introduced to our guide and began our journey. Aside from us, there were only two others on the tour.
<br />
<br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yc4WLP6MjGk/S0060NSus6I/AAAAAAAAAHM/t-V-vpG5L20/s1600-h/IMG_0279.JPG"><img style="display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yc4WLP6MjGk/S0060NSus6I/AAAAAAAAAHM/t-V-vpG5L20/s320/IMG_0279.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5426057794647143330" border="0"></a>
<br /><font style="font-style: italic;">In the van on the way to San Gimignano. We were excited!
<br /></font></div>
<br />The first leg of the journey was about a 40 minute drive. Our first stop was San Gimignano, a small, walled medieval town.
<br />
<br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yc4WLP6MjGk/S007ACoBtrI/AAAAAAAAAHU/GsoH9uUlpwk/s1600-h/IMG_0282.JPG"><img style="display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yc4WLP6MjGk/S007ACoBtrI/AAAAAAAAAHU/GsoH9uUlpwk/s320/IMG_0282.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5426057997942109874" border="0"></a>
<br /><font style="font-style: italic;">San Gimignano from a distance.
<br /></font></div>
<br />Its 13th century medieval architecture is incredibly well preserved. I was able to get a good sense of this; it just "feels" very old, with its worn, solid stone walls, cobbled streets and frequent narrow alleyways. We spent about 45 minutes there, during which we became more familiar with our guide, who was extremely warm and friendly.
<br />
<br />After leaving the town, we drove to the country villa where we were to have our cooking class. <a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yc4WLP6MjGk/S00_UQa5diI/AAAAAAAAAIk/H-fm8vwPmFw/s1600-h/IMG_0305.JPG"><img style="display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yc4WLP6MjGk/S00_UQa5diI/AAAAAAAAAIk/H-fm8vwPmFw/s320/IMG_0305.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5426062743289034274" border="0"></a>This is where the real fun began. We were introduced to our very friendly chef/instructor (and his mother, who also helped out) and a few minutes later, our lesson began.

<br /><font style="font-style: italic;">The ingredients.</font>
<br /></div>
<br />First, we were taught how to make pici pasta from scratch. This was interesting, very much hands-on and much simpler than I had expected once you have the basic idea. I knew that fresh pasta was basically dough, but somehow, i hadn't imagined that making and manipulating it would be just like any other dough. Also, I've never had or heard of pici pasta before.
<br />

<br />After this, we made two pasta sauces, one tomato-based and one cheese-based.

<br /><font style="font-style: italic;">
<br /></font>We learnt that Tuscans use a hell of a lot of extra virgin olive oil in their cooking. :) We used cayenne pepper in both of the sauces, which is something we've never used ourselves before and discovered that we quite like. Subsequently, we made a salad which, among other things, includes crumbled three day old bread soaked in water!
<br />
<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yc4WLP6MjGk/S00_rqpu-5I/AAAAAAAAAI0/0syZBGq9iJI/s1600-h/IMG_0298.JPG"><img style="display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 240px; height: 320px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yc4WLP6MjGk/S00_rqpu-5I/AAAAAAAAAI0/0syZBGq9iJI/s320/IMG_0298.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5426063145467575186" border="0"></a>
<br />We then made two kinds of bruschetta, as well as preparing three kinds of cheese with various accompaniments. One of the cheeses was covered in honey, sultanas, pine nuts and freshly ground nutmeg. Yum! Finally, we observed the preparation of chicken which would later be cooked in a sauce primarily consisting of orange juice.
<br /></div>
<br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yc4WLP6MjGk/S00-zN7tmPI/AAAAAAAAAIc/1w9X1JOi8s8/s1600-h/IMG_0302.JPG"><img style="display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yc4WLP6MjGk/S00-zN7tmPI/AAAAAAAAAIc/1w9X1JOi8s8/s320/IMG_0302.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5426062175685679346" border="0"></a> <font style="font-style: italic;">The gorgeous table setting.</font>
<br />
<br /></div>After quite a bit of socialising and a glass of red wine while we waited for our guide and his friend to return, we proceeded to eat. The food was delicious. In particular, the salad was divine; I've never had anything like it before. I also very much enjoyed the cheeses, particularly the one accompanied with honey, sultanas, etc.; I do like cheese, but especially like it with nice accompaniments. Each course was accompanied by a different wine. It was a long, lingering, social lunch - the best kind! Overall, I was thoroughly impressed by the fruits of our labour, though of course we had our instructors observing and making corrections as we worked. Whether we can replicate it by ourselves remains to be seen. :)

<br /></div>
<br />Jen: So that we didn't have to remember all the recipes, our lovely chef made us a cookbook to take home.
<br />
<br />Following lunch, our guide spontaneously took us up onto a big hill on the property to have a glass of wine. The view was spectacular, and it was such a perfect, clear day. (Jamie: There's nothing quite like fresh, crisp air in the middle of the peaceful, quiet countryside.)
<br />
<br />We then went to a local winery for a little tour and some tasting. The white wine there was spectacular, so we bought a bottle to drink the next day - pretty much the only white we've had over here. (Jamie: It, along with most of the other wines, only cost 5 Euro. 5 Euro! So cheap! I wish we could have brought some home with us.) We returned back to our hotel in high spirits, and received some exciting news the next day - Jamie's sister Ro was in labour! The beautiful Siena Rose Scott was born on 5th January at about 2.15am AEST, weighing in at 7 lbs 7 oz.
