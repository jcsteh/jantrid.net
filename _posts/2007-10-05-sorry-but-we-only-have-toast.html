I slept terribly last night. How unusual. Anyway, I felt pretty awful and as a result, the following conversation ensued between Jen and I:
<br /><blockquote>Jamie: "&lt;sighs heavily&gt; I feel like a dried out turd."
<br />Jen: "Well I'm sorry, but we only have toast."</blockquote>
<br />It made my morning seem so much more bearable. :)
