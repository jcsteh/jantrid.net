For a while now, I've been thinking about writing a tool to quickly perform all sorts of little miscellaneous tasks that I'm too lazy to do manually. They aren't big enough to each justify their own application, but nor are they at all related. These tasks include:<ul><li>Setting my computer's audio output volume to preset levels with a single keyboard shortcut</li><li>Killing off an application which is using too much CPU time and causing my computer to freeze or lag intolerably, thereby making killing it manually extremely difficult or tedious</li><li>Checking and reporting missed VoIP calls via my router</li></ul><br />I came up with a great name for this application: Jantrid Laziness Proliferator. Unfortunately, I'm too lazy to actually write it...
