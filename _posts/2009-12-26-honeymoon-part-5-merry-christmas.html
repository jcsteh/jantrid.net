Jen: Merry Christmas from Venice! We have spent today eating, drinking and gently drifting along the canal in a gondola. Same old, same old, really! As usual, we have built our day around a very long lunch - about three hours today, I think - and a couple of bottles of wine. We are now in our hotel room awaiting dinner time!<br /><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yc4WLP6MjGk/SzXU8HSyNvI/AAAAAAAAAEU/dKoTny6T6qY/s1600-h/018.JPG"><img style="display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yc4WLP6MjGk/SzXU8HSyNvI/AAAAAAAAAEU/dKoTny6T6qY/s320/018.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5419471855825336050" border="0" /></a><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yc4WLP6MjGk/SzXVKV5ENlI/AAAAAAAAAEc/xaK91vmTASc/s1600-h/019.JPG"><img style="display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yc4WLP6MjGk/SzXVKV5ENlI/AAAAAAAAAEc/xaK91vmTASc/s320/019.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5419472100262164050" border="0" /></a><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Christmas lunch.<br /><br /><br /></span></div><span style="font-style: italic;"><br /></span><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yc4WLP6MjGk/SzXVamaj7GI/AAAAAAAAAEk/JVkWmzPJuA8/s1600-h/014.JPG"><img style="display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yc4WLP6MjGk/SzXVamaj7GI/AAAAAAAAAEk/JVkWmzPJuA8/s320/014.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5419472379575528546" border="0" /></a><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-style: italic;">The high (or low?) point of the afternoon was when I said "Should we get another bottle of wine?" and Jamie replied, "It's Christmas!" </span><br /></div><br />We didn't just eat and drink today, though - we started out (after breakfast) by going to Piazza San Marco. Many of the shops were closed due to it being Christmas day but we still managed a look at the Basilica and the bell tower. I'm loving the calm of Venice - the total lack of cars etc is absolutely lovely, and the gentle (if a little bit smelly) lap of the canal is very peaceful.<br /><br />Here is a little video of our gondola ride. We have seen a lot of tourists spending their whole time in gondolas with video cameras poised - what is the point??! We only have a few seconds of footage here for you - we spent the rest of the time being a starry-eyed newlywed couple. Enjoy!<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><object id="BLOG_video-d50b2dfaaa9ca385" class="BLOG_video_class" contentid="d50b2dfaaa9ca385" height="266" width="320"></object><br /></div><br />Jamie: P.S. We just heard and saw a guy riding past our hotel loudly singing jingle bells in Italian while ringing his bicycle bell. Hilarious!
