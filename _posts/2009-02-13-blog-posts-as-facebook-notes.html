I've now imported my blog into <a href="http://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a>, so posts to this blog now also appear as notes on Facebook. This way, those of you who live primarily in the land of Facebook can't so easily avoid them. :) If you want to know how to do this yourself, see <a href="http://randell.ph/geeky/2009/01/31/import-blog-posts-into-facebook/">this post</a>.
