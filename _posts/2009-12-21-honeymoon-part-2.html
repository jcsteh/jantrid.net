Jamie: The trip to Bayswater went pretty smoothly. We caught a shuttle back to the airport and another bus to Liverpool Street Station, from where we decided to catch a cab rather than trying to lug our luggage on to the tube when we didn't really know where we were going. Our hotel (Queen's Park Hotel) was a bit old and quaint, but functional enough and spotlessly clean. The lift was a tiny, slow little box which could barely fit the two of us with our luggage. The room was smallish, though nothing on the Tune Hotel in Malaysia.<br /><br />Jen: In London, we got to see "We Will Rock You", "Hairspray", "The Lion King" and snow.<br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yc4WLP6MjGk/Sy59HbjX6dI/AAAAAAAAAAM/9yZSYQFs2no/s1600-h/038.JPG"><img style="display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/2009-12-21-038.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5417404968381966802" border="0" /></a>  <span style="font-style: italic;">Please ignore my bizarre facial expression and look only at the snow.</span><br /></div><br />All four were very exciting. We actually saw "Hairspray" and "The Lion King" on the same day, following a long and moderately boozy lunch at an Indian restaurant, so I fell asleep for a bit of Lion King, which I felt pretty bad about because it was a spectacular show. It was in one of the ballads, I think, and I woke up when Jamie nudged me to ask what had just happened on stage. I don't think he was particularly impressed when he realised he'd just woken me...<br /><br />Jamie: I found the theatre culture in London to be fascinating. It almost seems like theatre in London is as commonplace as going to the movies at home. This is evident not only in its easy availability (we purchased our tickets to Hairspray just a few hours before we saw it), but also in the enthusiastic response of the audience.<br /><br />Jen: After a few days in London we made the trek out to the main station and caught the Eurostar to Paris. As it turns out we're really lucky, because apparently all Eurostar trips between London and Paris have now been suspended due to problems with FIVE of them breaking down in the middle of the tunnel, resulting in people being stuck on the train, with no lights and heating, and with food all run out, for up to 16 hours. We caught the Eurostar the day before all this happened, and aren't catching it again thankfully.<br /><br />The weather in Paris has been cold but really nice - the novelty of snow has not worn off. Yesterday we found some lovely soft snow to walk in, as well as crunchy, slushy snow. (Jamie: Walking on the snow is quite an interesting and pleasant feeling. Sometimes, it almost just sounds and feels like gravel, but at others, it's more like walking on a fluffy, crunchy carpet.)<br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yc4WLP6MjGk/Sy59cMMPOKI/AAAAAAAAAAU/Ya1WhDr_XDI/s1600-h/043.JPG"><img style="display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 240px; height: 320px;" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/2009-12-21-043.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5417405325035649186" border="0" /></a><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">We spent a ridiculous amount of time playing in the snow.<br /></span></div><br />We also have been trying not to slip on the ice. Special thanks to Sharon and Terry for our fur-lined boots - they are amazing!!<br /><br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a onblur="try  {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yc4WLP6MjGk/Sy598OPXQCI/AAAAAAAAAAs/KIN-MfuKiOA/s1600-h/062.JPG"><img style="display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 240px; height: 320px;" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/2009-12-21-062.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5417405875341443106" border="0" /></a><span style="font-style: italic;">We have been rugging up a bit.</span><br /></div><br />Paris is quite beautiful in parts. The area our hotel is in is pretty average looking but the hotel itself is awesome (it helps that we got another room upgrade). Yesterday, after a cliched breakfast of croissants in a dodgy little cafe:<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yc4WLP6MjGk/Sy59s8H0kdI/AAAAAAAAAAc/Rt3rWIQujOU/s1600-h/041.JPG"><img style="display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 240px; height: 320px;" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/2009-12-21-041.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5417405612779934162" border="0" /></a>we caught the tube with the intention of getting off at the Eiffel Tower, but we went by Champs-Elysses station and decided to get off on a whim (OK, it's because of the Art vs Science song which starts with "The Champs-Elysses is a busy street...".) There were Christmas markets there which we spent ages at drinking mulled wine and hot chocolate with Baileys, and wandering around in the snow.<br /><br />We didn't make it to the Eiffel Tower (I saw it from a distance and that's enough - it looks really ugly...) and instead went to the Louvre. This was a highlight of the trip for Jamie...not. Having Jamie there was actually really awesome because it turns out that blindies get free entry into every museum and art gallery in France so we got to jump the queue and get in for free. And he didn't even die of boredom, because we got those headphone tour things so as we wandered round he could listen to all the socio-historical stuff. We did a 45 minute tour called "Masterpieces" which included Venus de Milo (the highlight for me - amazing)<br /><div style="text-align: center;"><div style="text-align: left;"><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yc4WLP6MjGk/Sy59z9mHkCI/AAAAAAAAAAk/YXt10s5_8Zg/s1600-h/047.JPG"><img style="display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 240px; height: 320px;" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/2009-12-21-047.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5417405733434527778" border="0" /></a> and Mona Lisa (not so breathtaking). I could have spent days there but that would have been a bit crap for Jamie. Today we found a chemist (we both have colds, unsurprisingly considering that it is below freezing!) and a laundromat (the only trip to a laundry we will need to make, thankfully.)<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yc4WLP6MjGk/Sy5-EnTk86I/AAAAAAAAAA0/sF0HscgvhMY/s1600-h/063.JPG"><img style="display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 240px; height: 320px;" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/2009-12-21-063.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5417406019508958114" border="0" /></a><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yc4WLP6MjGk/Sy5-NY3_xuI/AAAAAAAAAA8/QrnAHRB0fUs/s1600-h/064.JPG"><img style="display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 240px; height: 320px;" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/2009-12-21-064.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5417406170254001890" border="0" /></a><br /></div><span style="font-style: italic;">Note the tasteful picture of Jennifer Lopez in the background.</span><br /><br /></div> We then stepped into a gorgeous little bar/restaurant and ate and drank for 2 hours.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yc4WLP6MjGk/Sy5-VEcWnPI/AAAAAAAAABE/4pjjbLNPOXk/s1600-h/065.JPG"><img style="display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 240px; height: 320px;" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/2009-12-21-065.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5417406302208302322" border="0" /></a> <a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yc4WLP6MjGk/Sy5_daPC3wI/AAAAAAAAABc/dqTZIJ6FWTg/s1600-h/066.JPG"><img style="display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/2009-12-21-066.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5417407545008643842" border="0" /></a><br />I finished with the cheese platter and will not be needing dinner tonight.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yc4WLP6MjGk/Sy6A6gNgD1I/AAAAAAAAABk/q_vNixwLGC0/s1600-h/068.JPG"><img style="display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/2009-12-21-068.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5417409144340614994" border="0" /></a><br /><br />Jamie had pannacotta, and I think he nearly cried when he got to the last spoonful.

Well, I'm blogging and Jamie is complaining about packing. We do have more photos, but can only access the ones on my iPhone at the moment. Au revoir!
