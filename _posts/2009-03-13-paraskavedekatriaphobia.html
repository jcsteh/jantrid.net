The new <a href="http://bazaar-vcs.org/">Bazaar</a> <a href="https://launchpad.net/bzr/+announcement/2181">1.13rc1 release</a> is codenamed paraskavedekatriaphobia. Having no idea what the hell that was, I decided to look it up, and as usual, Wikipedia furnished me with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friday_the_13th#Phobia">the answer</a>: the fear of Friday the 13th. If I knew the smiley for rolling eyes, I'd be using it here...<br /><br />Well, you learn something new every day.
