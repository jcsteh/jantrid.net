This article is a rather interesting read:<br /><a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/guest_contributors/article5689367.ece">In praise of Darwin and the spirit of inquiry</a><br />While it is centred specifically on Christianity, it strongly advocates my fervent belief that science and spirituality/religion/faith are most definitely not mutually exclusive; rather, they should support each other.
